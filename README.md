# Digital-Image-Processing Programs

This repository contains Python programs for various image processing tasks using OpenCV and PIL (Pillow) libraries. Each program demonstrates a specific image processing technique, such as splitting an image into quadrants, erosion and dilation, rotation and scaling, edge detection, histogram equalization, and image segmentation.

## Programs Included

1. **Splitting an Image into Quadrants**
   - Description: Reads a digital image, splits it into four quadrants (up, down, right, and left), and displays each quadrant separately.
   - File: `split_image_into_quadrants.ipynb`

2. **Erosion, Dilation, and Edge Detection**
   - Description: Applies erosion and dilation to an image and demonstrates the effect on edge detection. Shows how to use OpenCV for these operations.
   - File: `erosion_dilation_edge_detection.ipynb`

3. **Image Rotation, Scaling, and Translation**
   - Description: Shows how to rotate an image, scale it, and translate it using PIL (Pillow) library. Demonstrates these transformations on an example image.
   - File: `image_rotation_scaling_translation.ipynb`

4. **Filtering Techniques: Edges and Textures**
   - Description: Applies Gaussian blur, Laplacian filter, Sobel filters, and Canny edge detection to an image. Demonstrates enhancement of low-level features.
   - File: `filtering_techniques_edges_textures.ipynb`

5. **Enhancing and Segmenting Low-Contrast Images**
   - Description: Demonstrates enhancing and segmenting low-contrast 2D images. Applies histogram equalization and Otsu's thresholding for segmentation.
   - File: `enhancing_segmenting_low_contrast_images.ipynb`
